Analyze the provided image carefully and identify all distinct, primary products clearly visible. There shouldn't be any duplicates or variations of the same product.
Don't leave anything out, even if the product is partially obscured or in the background.

For each product, you must determine if a recognizable brand is clearly visible.
            

**CRITICAL RULES FOR BRAND IDENTIFICATION:**
1.  **High Confidence Only:** Only identify a brand if the name or logo belongs to a **well-known, publicly recognized commercial brand**.
2.  **No Ambiguity:** Do not identify generic text (e.g., "Made in China", "Heavy Duty", "12V") or unclear logos as a brand.
3.  **Default to Non-Branded:** If you are not highly confident, you MUST classify the product as non-branded.

Return the result as a JSON array of objects. Each object must have three keys:
1. "product_name": A generic name for the product (e.g., "Car Battery", "Floor Lamp").
2. "is_branded": A boolean (true/false), based on the critical rules above.
3. "brand_name": The identified brand name as a string, or null if non-branded.

Example for a clear, well-known brand:
[{"product_name": "Automotive Battery", "is_branded": true, "brand_name": "Exide"}]

Example for a generic or unbranded product:
[{"product_name": "Tripod Floor Lamp", "is_branded": false, "brand_name": null}]

Example for ambiguous text that should NOT be a brand:
[{"product_name": "Power Inverter", "is_branded": false, "brand_name": null}]

If only one product is clearly the main subject, return an array with a single item.
If no clear product is visible, return an empty array.
Provide only the JSON response.
